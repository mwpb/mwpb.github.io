		1. The world is the totality of facts.

		2. A fact is a state of things that exists.
	</summary>
	A state of things is simply one way in which things could possibly combine.
	It can either exist in the world or not exist in the world.

		3. A logical picture of facts is a thought.
	</summary>
	In our minds we use pictures to represent states of things.
	If a picture represents a fact (a state of things that exists) then it is true.
	If a picture represents a state of things which does not exist then it is false.
	Every picture always represents some state of things but there is no guarantee that every state of things is represented by a picture.
	<br>
	The summary seems to be saying that a thought has to correspond to a state of things that exists in the world.

		4. A thought is a proposition with a sense.
	</summary>
	A proposition is an outward communication of a thought that is perceived by the senses.
	Therefore an outward communication of a state of things (that exists!?).

		5. A proposition is a truth-function of elementary propositions.
		(An elementary proposition is a truth-function of itself.)

		6. The general form of a truth-function is [p, E, N(E)].
		This is the general form of a proposition.
